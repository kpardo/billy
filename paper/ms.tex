\begin{abstract}
  PTFO$\,$8-8695b could be the youngest, shortest-period 
  hot Jupiter known.  However it has not been shown to be a planet.
  TESS recently observed PTFO$\,$8-8695 for one month.
  The TESS lightcurve shows that the dominant variability in this
  system is a sinusoidal modulation with a ``long'' period $P_{\rm
  \ell}$
  of 11.96 hours, likely caused by stellar rotation.
  Also present is a complex signal, previously identified as the
  planet candidate, that repeats with a ``short'' period $P_{\rm s}$ of
  10.74 hours.
  The ``long'' and ``short'' signals show the expected beat every 4.48
  days.
  There is a dip in the complex, short-period signal.
  However ground-based photometry from the past decade shows that the
  orbital phase of the dip seems to have instantaneously jumped, at
  least once, and maybe twice.
  The TESS epoch of the dip is consistent with recent observations by
  Tanimoto et al., and differs from the discovery epoch by 5.14 hours.
  Planets do not ``jump'' in orbital phase.
  Given the available evidence,
  PTFO$\,$8-8695 seems consistent with the
  ``transient dipping'' phenomenology observed in many young M dwarfs.
  It seems rather unlikely to be a planet.

\section{Introduction}
If PTFO$\,$8-8695b were a planet, it would be exceptional.
A transiting hot Jupiter, orbiting a $\approx$3$\,$Myr old M dwarf
in ORION would make it the youngest hot Jupiter known.
Its orbital period of only 12 HOURS would also make it the shortest
period hot Jupiter known.

% Section~\ref{sec:observations} of this paper presents all of the
% available transit data as well as the new radial velocity and speckle
% imaging observations.  Section~\ref{sec:analysis} describes our
% analysis of the data, and our interpretation that WASP-4 is being
% pulled around by a brown dwarf or low-mass star.
% Section~\ref{sec:discussion} places this result within the context of
% orbital decay searches, and points out that line-of-sight
% accelerations will be a relatively common type of ``false positive.''
% Section~\ref{sec:conclusions} offers concluding remarks.

\subsection{Observations}

PTFO 8-8695 was observed by TESS with Camera 1, CCD 1, from December
15, 2018 to January 6, 2019, during the sixth sector of science
operations.  The star was designated TIC 264461976 in the TESS Input
Catalog \citep{stassun_TIC_2018,stassun_TIC8_2019}.  The pixel data
for an $11\times11$ array surrounding PTFO 8-8695 were averaged into
2-minute stacks by the onboard computer.  Each 2048$\times$2048 image
from the CCD was also averaged into 30-minute stacks, and saved as a
``full frame image'' (FFI).

The 2-minute stacks for PTFO 8-8695 were then reduced to lightcurves
by the Science Processing Operations Center (SPOC) at NASA
Ames~\citep{jenkins_tess_2016}.  Our main analysis used the resulting
Presearch Data Conditioning (PDC) lightcurve.  The PDC lightcurve
aperture used pixels chosen to maximize the SNR of the total flux of
the target \citep{smith_kepler_apertures_2017}.  Non-astrophysical
variability was removed through the methods discussed by
\citet{smith_kepler_PDC_2017}.

As an independent check on the shorter cadence SPOC light-curve, we
separately processed the 30-minute image stacks as part of the Cluster
Difference Imaging Photometric Survey (CDIPS;
\citep{bouma_cluster_2019}).  The CDIPS lightcurve used a circular
aperture with radius 1 pixel.

To clean the data, we removed all points with non-zero quality flags
\citep[{\it e.g.},][]{tess_data_product_description_2018}.  We also
masked out the first and last 6 hours of each orbit, since there is
often systematic red noise during those times.  Both the CDIPS and PDC
lightcurves showed a clear discontinuous ``jump'' in the last few days
of orbit 20, which seemed likely to be an instrumental systematic.  We
correspondingly masked out times from BJD 2458488.3 until the end of
the orbit.  The PDC lightcurve initially had 15{,}678 points.  The
quality cut removed 854 points, masking the orbit edges removed an
additional 716, and removing the final few days of orbit 20 removed an
additional 1079.  After cleaning, 83\% of the initial flux
measurements remained.

We normalized these points by dividing out the median flux. We then
subtracted by unity to simplify subsequent analysis.  Many of these
and subsequent processing steps were performed using
\texttt{astrobase}~\citep{bhatti_astrobase_2018}. 


\subsection{Visual Inspection}

Our initial inspection of the lightcurve, in both its 2-minute PDCSAP
and 30-minute FFI forms, showed a strong sinusoidal beat signal
(Figure~\ref{fig:splitsignal}, top panel).

As a precursor to more detailed analysis, we calculated generalized
Lomb-Scargle periodograms using \texttt{astrobase}
\citep{lomb_1976,scargle_studies_1982,vanderplas_periodograms_2015,bhatti_astrobase_2018}.
The two largest peaks in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the
lightcurve were clearly separated at a ``short'' period $P_{\rm s}
\approx 0.448\,{\rm days}$ and a ``long'' period $P_{\rm \ell} \approx
0.499\,{\rm days}$.  The $P_{\rm \ell}$ peak had the greater power of
the two.  Smaller harmonics from each of these two dominants peaks
were also present.

% 0.14 = A1+A2
% 0.06 = A1-A2
% 2A1 = 0.20
% -> A1 = 0.1
% 2A2 = 0.08
% -> A2 = 0.04

The peak-to-peak amplitude at maximum, when the two signals
constructively interfere, is about 14\%.  At minimum, the peak-to-peak
amplitude is about 6\%.  Assuming the signals are just two sinusoids,
algebra tells us that the peak-to-peak amplitudes should therefore be
10\% for the long-period signal, and 4\% for the short-period signal.
These order-of-magnitude numbers will turn out to be roughly correct.

Initial signal-processing experiments fitting out splines or sinusoids
showed that after subtracting out the long-period signal, the
short-period signal dominated the periodogram, and vice-versa.
However it quickly became clear that it would be beneficial to
simultaneously model the signals separately, in order to preserve the
power at each frequency.



\section{The Model}
\label{sec:analysis}

\subsection{Model Description}

We opted to model the lightcurve as a linear combination of Fourier
harmonics at the short and long periods, plus a transit at the short
period.  Symbolically, the total flux $f$ is given as
\begin{equation}
  f = f_{\rm s} + f_{\rm \ell}
  = f_{\rm transit,s} + f_{\rm Fourier,s} + f_{\rm Fourier,\ell},
\end{equation}
where $f_{\rm s}$ is the relative flux at the short period, and
$f_{\rm \ell}$ is the flux at the long period.  Writing out the
Fourier terms,
\begin{align}
  f = &f_{\rm transit,s} + \sum_{n=1}^{N} A_n \sin(n\omega_{\rm s}t)
  + \sum_{n=1}^{N} B_n \cos(n\omega_{\rm s}t)\\
  &+ \sum_{m=1}^{M} A_m \sin(m[\omega_{\rm \ell}t+\phi_{\rm \ell}])
  + \sum_{m=1}^{M} B_m \cos(m[\omega_{\rm \ell}t+\phi_{\rm \ell}]), \nonumber
\end{align}
for $N$ and $M$ the total number of harmonics at the short and long
periods, respectively, $A_i$ and $B_i$ the amplitudes for each
harmonic term (potentially negative), and $\omega_i = 2\pi / P_i$ the
angular frequency for $i$ the short or long period index.  We fixed
the ``phase-offset'' for the short period signal to be zero, and let
the reference time for the long period signal float by introducing
$\phi_{\rm \ell}$.  Since we did not a priori know how many harmonics
would be appropriate, we considered a number of different choices for
$N$ and $M$, and used the Bayesian information criterion to choose the
appropriate model (Table~\ref{tab:modelcompare}).

As an example, one possible model could be a transit, plus $N=2$
harmonics of sines and cosines at the short period, plus $M=1$
harmonics at the long period.  In this case, the free parameters would
be as follows.  For the transit, we would fit for the impact
parameter, the planet-to-star radius ratio, two quadratic limb
darkening parameters, the planet orbital period (equal to the short
period), the reference time for the transit, and the mean flux.  There
would be $2N=4$ additional Fourier amplitudes at the short period,
plus $2M=2$ Fourier amplitudes at the long period, and well as the
long period itself and its phase.  For this case, we therefore fitted
14 free parameters.

We implemented and fitted the models using \texttt{PyMC3}, which is
built on \texttt{theano}
\citep{salvatier_2016_PyMC3,exoplanet:theano}.  For the Fourier terms,
we used the default math operators.  For the exoplanet transit, we
used the model and derivatives implemented in \texttt{exoplanet}
\citep{exoplanet:exoplanet}.  Our priors are listed in
Table~\ref{tab:posterior}.  To speed up the fitting, we binned the
cleaned 2 minute lightcurves to 10 minute bins.  We correspondingly
scaled the uncertainties in the flux measurements by a factor of
$\sqrt{5}$.  Before sampling, we initialized each model to the maximum
a posteriori (MAP) solution.  We then sampled using \texttt{PyMC3}'s
gradient-based No-U-Turn Sampler \citep{hoffman_no-u-turn_2014}, and
used $\hat{R}$ as our convergence diagnostic
\citep{gelman_inference_1992}.
We tested our ability to successfully recover injected parameters
using synthetic data, before switching to the actual PTFO 8-8695
lightcurves.


\subsection{Fitting Results}

\input{model_comparison_table.tex}
%\input{model_posterior_table.tex}

We considered nine models, with the number of harmonics per frequency
$N$ and $M$ ranging from one to three.  To select our preferred model,
we used the Bayesian information criterion
(Table~\ref{tab:modelcompare}).  The model with the lowest BIC had
two harmonics at the short 11.74$\,$hr period, and two harmonics
at the long 11.96$\,$hr period.  All of the models have reduced
$\chi^2$ ranging between 1.37 and 1.51, which suggests a plausible,
though not perfect agreement between the data and models.

To explore where each model succeeded and failed, we split the raw
signal into its respective components (Figures~\ref{fig:splitsignal}
and~\ref{fig:splitsignalii}).  We also examined the phase-folded
signals (Figure~\ref{fig:phasefold}).  

In every model, the variability at the long period is a simple
sinusoid with peak-to-peak amplitude $\approx$10\%
(Figure~\ref{fig:phasefold}, top).  The variability at the short
period is always more complex.  A dip of depth $\approx$1.2\%, fit in
our model as a transit, lasts $\approx$0.75 hours.  Superposed on the
dip is a complex signal with peak-to-peak amplitude of about 4\%,
which peaks near phase 0.25, and reaches minimum brightness between
phases -0.5 and -0.25.

Outside of the primary dip, the short-period signal is relatively
smooth, at least from phases 0 to 0.5.  However the short-period
signal is asymmetric.  The flux from phases -0.5 to 0 shows what could
be a discontinuous jump, shortly after reaching minimum.  This jump
was visible in each of the nine models we considered, with different
choices for the number of harmonics.


 
% The main result that both models agree on: the extra power at the
% orbital frequency seems to not be ellipsoidal. Both of these models
% prefer to put the power at 1x the orbital frequency, not 2x the
% orbital frequency! This gives both Aorb0 and Borb0 non-zero, while
% Aorb1 and Borb1 seem to be more consistent with zero.




% The periodogram of the final residual (Figure~\ref{fig:splitsignal}
% bottom row) shows a weakly significant, poorly resolved peak at
% $\approx$8 days, consistent with the visual impression in the time
% domain that there could be a weak long-period signal present.


\subsection{Blend considerations}
\label{subsec:blend}

The TESS pixels are $\approx21$'' per side, and so we need to consider
whether light from neighboring stars could affect the photometry.  The
scene is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:scene}.  
The pixels used to
measure the background level are indicated with an `\texttt{X}' hatch,
and the pixels used for the final lightcurve are shown with the
`\texttt{/}' hatch.

The target star, PTFO
8-8605 (TIC 264461976), has a $T$-band magnitude of 14.0, and its position is shown with a
star.  
The other (unlabeled) star inside the target aperture, TIC 264461979, has $T=16.8$ and so cannot
contribute a signal with relative amplitude 10\%.
The only neighbor that is sufficiently close and bright that
its light might contaminate the target star is TIC 264461980, with
$T=14.8$, which we denote ``Star A''.  Star A is 23.6'' NW of our
target, and based on the magnitude difference could contribute up to
48\% the flux of our target star, PTFO 8-8695.  

Because PTFO 8-8695 has previously been identified to have periodicity
consistent with our measurement of $P_{\rm s}$, our main concern
regarding blending is the degree to which we can be certain that the
long-period signal at $P_{\rm \ell}$ also originates from PTFO 8-8695.
We took two approaches towards determining the source of the long-period signal.

First, we examined the CDIPS full frame image lightcurves of the
target, which are available on MAST \citep{bouma_cluster_2019}.
The maximal peak-to-peak beat amplitude is consistently $\approx$10\%
across apertures of radii 1, 1.5, and 2.25 pixels.
If Star A were the source of the long-period variability, we would expect the
peak variability amplitude to be smallest in the 1 pixel aperture, based on the
separation of the sources (Figure~\ref{fig:scene}, bottom).
From this test alone, it seems unlikely that Star A is the source of
the long-period signal.

Second, we examined the lightcurve of each pixel in the scene
individually.  We opted to use the
interactive tools implemented in
\texttt{lightkurve} \citep{lightkurve_2018}.  If Star A were the
source of the long-period variability, we would expect the pixels
nearest to Star A to show a sinusoidal signal with
amplitude exceeding $10\%$.  We find no evidence for
this being the case.  The pixel directly below Star A does not
clearly show the sinusoidal variability, and the peak-to-peak 
variability in that pixel is $\lesssim 8\%$.  In contrast, the
south-easternmost pixel within PTFO 8-8695's aperture (the pixel 
furthest from Star A that was used in the optimal aperture) shows the $P_{\rm \ell}$ sinusoidal
variability signal at $\approx 10\%$ amplitude.

As there is no evidence in favor of a blend scenario, we
conclude that both the $P_{\rm s}$ and $P_{\rm \ell}$ signals originate from PTFO 8-8695.
